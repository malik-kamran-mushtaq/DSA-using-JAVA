# DSA-using-JAVA
Problems of all the DSA topics using JAVA.

This repository contains the folders of practice questions of all the DSA topics from basics to medium and some advanced as well. The questions for every problem is written in the comments above every code.

I will keep adding many more questions to this repository with comments so everyone can understand. It will take me around 3 months to fill this repository with the questions from all the topics from DSA.

The number of questions will be around 500 out of which 100 will be basic and 400 will be interview-centric.

"All the code files are in JAVA language."
